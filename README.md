A series of (hopefully cool!) exercises for those eager to learn Go


## Setting Up Your Go Environment

As new versions of the Go suite are released you will want an
easy way to stay up to date. So please follow the [Setup](setup-environment.md)
guide to install Go and build your workspace.

It is best to get this right the first time around so if you have
trouble please ask for help!


## Exercises

Most of the exercises assume that you have already traversed a basic tutorial on Go.
If you find the first exercise overwhelming, you should probably try working through a tutorial and returning.

If this is your first look at Go, then a great place to start is [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro).

### Instructors

Hopefully you will have instructors available to work with while learning. Never be
afraid to ask instructors for help or clarification. There is no such thing as a _stupid_ question.

### Comprehension Tasks (Important!)

Some of the exercises include _Comprehension Tasks_ that require you to read and explain
portions of Go code. To properly execute a comprehension-task you should deliver your explanation to
an instructor.

### Engineering Tasks

Engineering tasks will ask you to write some code, usually an application of some sort.
Be ready to demo your application when it it completed. Instructors want to see it in action!


## Recommended Resources

There's no need to read through all of these resources but keep them handy when you need a reminder.
