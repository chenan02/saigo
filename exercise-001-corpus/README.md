# Description
Write a console application that counts the frequencies of words that appear in a text document.

# Input
Your application should accept a single command-line argument containing the path of the text file.

Example:
```
$ ./corpus romeo_and_juliet.txt 7oldsamr.txt
```

# Output
Your application should produce a list of words and their frequencies _sorted in reverse numerical order_.

Example:
```
36 the
18 and
14 to
12 a
10 old
10 of
10 in
9 they
7 for
6 you
6 seven
6 samurai
6 robbers
6 raiko
...
```
In case of ties, any ordering is fine.
