## Prepare!

As mentioned in the [introduction](https://git.enova.com/nyukin/saigo), learners should browse Caleb Doxsey's [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)
before beginning the exercises. More specifically you should have some exposure to the first nine chapters (they're not long)

## Recommended Practice

Read through a single chapter and try out some of the exercises at the end. Schedule a brief (ten-minute) session with an
instructor to:

1. Go over what you have learned (explain the material back to the instructor)
2. Discuss some of the exercises - most of them are super short
