## Prepare!

As mentioned in the [introduction](https://git.enova.com/nyukin/saigo), learners should browse Caleb Doxsey's [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)
before beginning the exercises. More specifically you should have some exposure to the first nine chapters (they're not long)

## Setup

1. Create a new Github repository called `saigo_book_exercises`.
2. Create the appropriate directories for your source code
    ```bash
      mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/git.enova.com/<your-username>/
      cd $GOPATH/src/git.enova.com/<your-username>/
      git clone <your-git-repository>
      cd saigo_book_exercises
      mkdir chapter_002
      cd chapter_002
    ```

    Any work you produce for Chapter 2 can be placed in this directory.

    To learn more about the directory hierarchy, check out [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)

## Recommended Practice

Read through a single chapter and try out some of the exercises at the end. Schedule a brief (ten-minute) session with an
instructor to:

1. Go over what you have learned (explain the material back to the instructor)
2. Discuss some of the exercises - most of them are super short
